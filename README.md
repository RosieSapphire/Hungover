# Hungover
> Okay, I'm gonna be honest, this "README.md" is going to serve as more of a scratch-pad for the game's development, so unless you're into really bad writing and temporary bullshit that might not be in the game or interesting at all, don't even bother reading. This is my first game and oh BOY is it gonna show, even later into development. I know it's not gonna be even remotely close to perfect, but I hope to GOD I can make a fun, engaging game that people actually enjoy. That's literally all I fucking want. I know some people will hate it and that it'll be really controversial with some people, but this game isn't for everyone, and that's okay. Trust me, things get nasty. :/
## Story
The game starts with a back-view of the player's car driving down the road before it switches to a first-person view of them pulling up to the parking lot of a gas station named "Square C" (an obvious ripoff of Circle K). During the time in the car, the player is seen smoking a cigarette, putting it out and stomping it once exiting the car. If the player looks closely enough, as this is extremely fast, they will see that the cigarette which was just stomped out has a blue filter. Nothing is said about this, but it comes up in just a moment and is a nice touch for players paying attention or even repeat players, idk.

Anyway, upon entering the store, he looks over to the cashier, Dave. Something is off about him. He looks *mostly* normal, but something is definitely fucked up about him. He says "Hey, Da-... oh..." before proceeding to move on the aisles, making his way over to the snacks.

In the middle of his journey to get some fucking munchy-foods, some random guy in a suit comes up and is oddly energetic and eccentric. Seems very excited to be talking to you about whatever the hell he's talking about. Suddenly, he asks for a cigarette and the player pulls the pack out of his pocket while saying "Yeah, sure dude. Everybody needs a good smo-". It's at this point he realizes that the motherfucker he was just talking to is no longer there as the last words coming out of his mouth echo through the halls. Not like normal though, where they bounce off the walls of the store, but instead the walls of his mind.

From here, confusion sets in, and then eventually panic when he realizes there's a chance he smoked one of his PCP cigarettes, indicated by them having a blue filter (I told you it'd come up :3). He leads with "Wait, nonononoono, FUCK!" as he frantically pulls one of the cigarettes out of the pack and inspects the filter, to which it is indeed blue. He frantically attempts to calm himself down, a futile attempt for sure, and drops whatever he was planning on getting and storms out of the store.

From here, he tries approaching his car and go inside, but upon opening the door, it falls off and the rest of the car folds and falls over like origami and melts into the ground with blue sparks flying. Once it disappeared, he looks up from the mess happening in front of him to realize what was once a simple parking lot has turned into a long straight stretch road in both directions. In one direction, there is a sweltering desert just unnaturally plopped there. Similarly, on the other side, there is a dense rainforest-looking area also equally unnaturally posted up. There are two options on where to go, and not really much of anything else.

### Choosing the Forest
At some point going down the forest, you will eventually meet up with a bear who wants to fuck your shit up. He is tall, black, has beady yellow glowing eyes and morphs in an out of shape similar to a skin-walker. It's hard to tell if the fucker is even real. Using the powers of PCP, you use your Chevrolegs to get a motherfucking move on away from that spooky son of a bitch.

After a certain distance of running, you stumble across a log-cabin which looks like it was abandoned by some Arizona ranger or some shit. Water-logged map on the wall, desk with random documents strewn about, but most importantly, for the current situation, a big-iron. Chambered in .45 Colt and a barrel longer than Ron Jeremy's cock, this thing is a motherfucking beast! Nevertheless, it's gonna be real handy in taking down that fucked up looking bear at bare minimum.

Inside the cabin, there is a reference to Jason Vorhees by there being a machete and a hockey mask hung up on the wall. You can take the bloody machete and have that as a secondary.

Exiting the shed, you engage the bear using either the machete or the revolver. If you use the revolver, it will take no more than 2 shots. If you use the machete it will take anywhere from 3-6 hits. It's less predictable, but remember that you're on PCP and you have additional strength compared to normal.

There are a few beasties of a fucked up nature throughout the rest of the forest. You only have 6 shots in your revolver if you decided to machete the bear, and 4 shots if you shot his stupid ass instead. Either way, you are up shit creek with only your hands as paddles, so you better make the most of what you got. As it stands, you have three options when it comes to combat at this point.
1. Use the revolver to one-shot anything else that's in your path, exchanging *extremely* limited ammo for convenience.
2. Use the machete, which is hard because of how precisely you need to line up your hits for them to not take damage from you before you do them, increasing risk in exchange for your own precision.
3. Run like a little bitch. There's no shame in it, especially with what limited resources you have. Although, if you have multiple things chasing you, there might not be any choice other than to kill their asses, so you will need to bounce between these 3 at different points depending on what the current situation calls for and what you're specifically up against.

Some other examples of "animals" you would come across in this section are fucked up foxes, squirrels, rabbits, and what would effectively be a "not-deer". This vaguely looks like a deer until it gets close, at which point it stands up on its hind legs, extremely tall, its eyes are forward instead of on the side, it has far too many teeth, and instead of the normal deer mouth, that shit splits all the way to the back of their head like a motherfucking eldrich entity, able to bite your entire fucking head off with one swift bite. Kill it and fast, or get the FUCK out of the way, no exceptions.

Essentially, you can skirt your way around it if you creep slowly around and far enough away, but the second it notices you, it gets up on the hind legs, and sprints at you with fuck-off speed. At this point, your only options are to repeatedly narrowly dodge its attacks as it lunges towards you or blow its head off with 2 clean shots. Using the machete is even more of a risk than it is with the other ones, because one mis-timed swing and you are instantly fucking dead. It *can* be done, but you are putting yourself at more of a risk than a reward. Good for TASers and OSU players I guess.

### Choosing the Dessert

## Gameplay
### General
- I don't know where this would fit in, but somewhere early on in the game, inside of a store, when you don't have a gun, you can pick up different items in the store and thundercunt them at the guy you're trying to fuck over. This would have to take place in an aisle where there are a lot of cans, jars, glass bottles, whatnot. Each of them have different types of damage. The cans are just pure blunt-force trauma, but the jars and glass bottles will be that in addition to bleeding damage and shrapnel. Such shrapnel could even fling off and hit other people if you charge up your throw hard enough.

### Drugs
#### Opiates
Pros
- You have substantially reduced health loss and pain reduction, causing you to almost be invincible for a bit. When you take damage, you take only 1/4 of the damage you would normally take while the drug is active.

Neutral
- Once it wears off, all of the damage you took while high gets multiplied by 4. For example, if you have 2 tabs of health before getting high, and you take 1/4 tab worth of damage (so, what would normally be 1 full tab of damage), then once it wears off, you only have 1 tab of health left. To mitigate this, make sure to use a healing item before it wears off. If you have, once again, 2 tabs of health, and you take 2/4 of damage (what would normally be 2 tabs of health) you will be alive and able to fight through it while still high, but once it wears off, and the damage gets converted/up-scaled, you will die almost instantly. There may or may not be a grace period after the drug wears off for you to heal, but 2/4 tabs or more of damage when starting at 2 full tabs of health, you WILL die.

Cons
- The withdrawals are absolutely fucking horrible if you take it more than a few times. Even coming down without withdrawing will reduce your energy and strength for a little bit after discontinued use. But if you withdrawal, you ain't doing shit for a little bit (have to figure out a way to implement this that doesn't completely rape the pacing of the game). You are fucking crawling everywhere until you are over it.
